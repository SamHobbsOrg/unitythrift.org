<h1>Unity Thrift Store</h1>
<p>This is for the organization described in
    <a href="https://yellow.place/en/unity-thrift-and-outreach-animal-rescue-taft-usa">
    Unity Thrift and Outreach Animal Rescue - Taft, United States</a>.
    The domain name had expired and was available for anyone to purchase.
    I purchased it but I want to give it to them. I can create a simple
    website for them. It is not known what other information in that page
    is accurate.</p>
<p>The following are more pages (found by searching) about the same
    organization and it is not known what is valid and what is not except I
    know that the Unity Thrift Store is at <i>327 Center Street</i>.</p>
